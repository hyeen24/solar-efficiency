## Problem Statement
Maximising solar power generation involves strategically managing operational and manpower costs,
 particularly by leveraging forecasted weather data to optimise operational planning. During
 high-efficiency days, which are influenced by favourable weather conditions, increasing battery capacity
 allows for the storage of excess power generated, ensuring a steady supply even during less optimal
 periods. Investing in advanced energy storage solutions and grid integration technologies is crucial.
 Conversely, low-efficiency days provide an ideal window for scheduled maintenance. By taking some
 panel arrays offline for cleaning and repairs during these periods, downtime is minimised, and overall
 system performance is maintained. Efficient management of these aspects ensures maximum power
 generation and reliability of solar power systems.
 As an Artificial Intelligence Engineer at SolaraTech, your primary responsibility is to develop models that
 classify solar panel efficiency as ‘Low’, ‘Medium’, or ‘High’. By leveraging historical same day forecasted
 weather data, you will implement predictive algorithms that identify and learn from patterns associated
 with varying efficiency levels.
 These models will be instrumental in strategically managing the company’s operational and manpower
 costs, optimising energy production on high-efficiency days and scheduling maintenance during
 low-efficiency periods. Your work will ensure that SolaraTech maximises power output while maintaining
 cost-effectiveness and reliability.
